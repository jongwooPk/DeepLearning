# DeepLearning
These are codes that I ran after listening the deep learning lectures. For now there are two examples that I solved using Gradient Descent Rule

* [Boston Housing Price expectation](https://github.com/jongwooPk/DeepLearning/blob/master/Boston%20Housing%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb) (regression)
* MNIST Handwritten Digits (multi-classification) recognition
